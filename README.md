# Machine Learning Pipeline Project

This project implements a machine learning pipeline that includes data processing, model training, prediction, and explainability features. The pipeline is designed to be modular and easy to extend.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets and related documentation.
  - **README.md**: Documentation related to the data used in the project, including sources, formats, and preprocessing steps.

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
  - **data_processing/**: Contains scripts for data preprocessing.
    - **preprocess.py**: Functions for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for model training.
  
  - **model_training/**: Contains scripts for training the machine learning model.
    - **train.py**: Responsible for loading data, defining model architecture, training the model, and saving it for future predictions.
  
  - **prediction_engine/**: Contains the prediction engine for making classifications.
    - **predict.py**: Functions to load the trained model, preprocess input data, and return predictions.
  
  - **explainability/**: Contains scripts for model explainability.
    - **feature_importance.py**: Calculates and returns the importance of each feature used in the model.
    - **shap_values.py**: Computes SHAP values to provide insights into feature contributions to predictions.
  
  - **utils/**: Contains utility functions used across the project.
    - **helpers.py**: Functions for data loading, saving models, and other helper functionalities.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project, including libraries for machine learning, data processing, and explainability.

- **README.md**: Overall documentation for the project, including setup instructions, usage examples, and descriptions of the main components.

- **config.yaml**: Configuration settings for the project, such as paths to data, model parameters, and other adjustable settings.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ml-pipeline-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the `config.yaml` file as needed.

## Usage
